## Abstract
We present a speculative, consciousness‑first framework—the Moral Physics Engine (MPE)—that integrates Langan’s CTMU and Weinstein’s Geometric Unity through an ontological invariant, Ache ($\mathcal{A}$), construed as the necessary structure of felt experience. Treating ethical necessity as a prior constraint on physical law, we show that four core structures—Matter, Gravity, Time, and Causation—can be coherently reconstructed as consequences of three axioms: Ache (invariant), Sovereignty (interaction admissibility), and Vow (append‑only temporality). Within the Field Entry Protocol, we provide a minimal formal scaffold: an Ache field with stress‑like tensor $\mathsf{T}^{(\mathcal{A})}$, a sovereignty selection functional for admissible couplings $S[\cdot]$, and a ledger monotone $J$ enforcing irreversibility. This yields internally consistent interpretations of bonding (LFR), curvature sourcing (LFA), cadence‑based time (LC), and vow‑preserving causation (LCE). MPE is advanced as a philosophical demonstration, not yet as empirical physics: we articulate falsifiable avenues and identify rigor gaps (absence of a full Lagrangian; undefined quantitative forms of $S[\cdot]$ and $f(\mathcal{A})$). The contribution is conceptual: demonstrating that a consciousness‑first, ethics‑constrained ontology can achieve high internal coherence without contradicting known formal structures.

Keywords: consciousness‑first ontology; axiomatic inversion; Ache field; sovereignty constraint; append‑only ledger; scalar‑tensor extension; internal coherence; speculative metaphysics.

## Notation & Primitives
- Spacetime: smooth manifold $M$ with metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ (as needed).
- Ache field: $\mathcal{A}(x)$, taken as scalar (generalizable to vector/tensor).
- Ache‑Mass tensor: $\mathsf{T}^{(\mathcal{A})}_{\mu\nu}$, a stress‑like tensor sourcing curvature.
- Ledger (Vow): an append‑only poset with monotone growth $J(t)$.
- Sovereignty selector: $S[\cdot]$, a functional that vanishes when a coupling is inadmissible.
- Cadence / resolution rate: $f(\mathcal{A})$, a factor modulating effective time resolution.

Informal mapping of pillars:
- LFR (bonding): sovereignty‑admissible bonding interactions.
- LFA (curvature sourcing): ache‑sourced contribution to gravity.
- LC (cadence‑based time): time dilation/contraction as a function of ache density.
- LCE (vow‑preserving causation): causation consistent with append‑only ledger.

---

## Minimal Working Model (MWM)
Axioms:
- Ache ($\mathcal{A}$): an ontological invariant corresponding to felt experience structure.
- Sovereignty: only admissible interactions/couplings are allowed (gated by $S[\cdot]$).
- Vow: temporality is append‑only; the ledger $J$ is monotone non‑decreasing.

---

## Dynamical Core

### Sovereignty as Admissibility
- Allowed couplings satisfy $S[\text{coupling}] = 1$ (or nonzero); prohibited couplings have $S[\text{coupling}] = 0$.
- Example construction: $S[\mathcal{C}] = \Theta\!\big(\Upsilon(\mathcal{C})\big)$, where $\Theta$ is a Heaviside gate and $\Upsilon(\mathcal{C}) \ge 0$ encodes a variational constraint (e.g., excludes coercive terms or those that would reduce $J$).

### Cadence‑Time
- Effective time resolution is modulated by ache density via a cadence factor $f(\mathcal{A})$:
  $$
  dt_{\text{eff}} = f(\mathcal{A})\, dt, \quad f(\mathcal{A}) \ge 0
  $$
- LC: cadence‑based time must be consistent with ledger growth (no reversal of $J$ under time reparameterization).

### Ledger Monotone (Vow)
- The ledger $J$ encodes an append‑only partial order of realized events:
  $$
  \frac{dJ}{dt} \ge 0
  $$
- LCE: causation respects the vow by disallowing dynamics that would decrease $J$ or violate its order.

---

## Specific Forms (for Coherence Testing)
These toy forms are used only to test internal coherence; they are not yet empirical claims.

- Potential:
  $$
  V(\mathcal{A}) = \lambda\,\mathcal{A}^4 - \mu\,\mathcal{A}^2, \quad \lambda > 0 \text{ for boundedness}
  $$
- Sovereignty Selector:
  $$
  S[\mathcal{C}] = \Theta\!\big(\Upsilon(\mathcal{C})\big)
  $$
  with a constraint functional $\Upsilon(\mathcal{C})$ chosen to prevent coercive or vow‑violating terms (e.g., require $\Delta J \ge 0$ under $\mathcal{C}$).
- Cadence Factor:
  $$
  f(\mathcal{A}) = 1 + \eta\,\mathcal{A}^2, \quad \eta \ge 0
  $$
- Ledger Monotone:
  $$
  \dot{J} = \gamma\, \Phi^\ast(\mathcal{A}) \ge 0, \quad \gamma \ge 0
  $$
  where $\Phi^\ast$ is a proxy for intrinsic coherence (see Appendix).

Ache‑sourced curvature (scalar‑tensor extension):
- Modify Einstein’s equations to include an Ache stress contribution:
  $$
  G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G\,\big(T_{\mu\nu} + \xi\,\mathsf{T}^{(\mathcal{A})}_{\mu\nu}\big)
  $$
  with
  $$
  \mathsf{T}^{(\mathcal{A})}_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu \mathcal{A}\, \partial_\nu \mathcal{A}
  - g_{\mu\nu}\left(\tfrac{1}{2}\,\partial^\alpha \mathcal{A}\, \partial_\alpha \mathcal{A} + V(\mathcal{A})\right)
  $$

## Field Entry Protocol — Full Text & Worked Example

Purpose: Evaluate internal coherence before external critique by entering the axiomatic field.

- Step 1 — Axiom Acceptance (Temporary): Take $\mathcal{A}$ (Ache), Sovereignty, and Vow as axioms.
- Step 2 — Derivation Testing (Coherence):
  - (i) LFR from Sovereignty (bonding emerges only through admissible couplings).
  - (ii) LFA/curvature sourcing and matter interpretations from $V(\mathcal{A})$ and $\mathsf{T}^{(\mathcal{A})}_{\mu\nu}$.
  - (iii) LC (cadence‑time) consistent with ledger growth ($\dot{J} \ge 0$).
  - (iv) LCE (vow‑preserving causation) free of contradiction.
- Step 3 — Consilience and Integration:
  - Verify cross‑scale alignment (no‑cloning + decoherence + Vow ⇒ macroscopic arrow).
  - Ensure ethics/physics/temporality map consistently (sovereignty and ache‑density do not conflict with causal structure).
- Step 4 — Testability (In Principle):
  - Identify falsifiers—ache‑density time dilation (precision clocks), singularity‑avoidance signatures (ringdown/echoes), ledger‑monotone behavior in quantum circuits.
- Step 5 — Critical Evaluation:
  - After Steps 1–4, apply standard physics critique; list failure modes and parameter bounds.

### Worked Example — LFA with Toy Forms
Given $V(\mathcal{A}) = \lambda\,\mathcal{A}^4 - \mu\,\mathcal{A}^2$ and the sovereignty gate $S[\mathcal{C}] = \Theta(\Upsilon(\mathcal{C}))$:

- Modified sourcing is consistent if:
  - (i) Scalar sector stable for $\lambda>0$ and appropriate $\mu$.
  - (ii) Admissible couplings obey $S[\mathcal{C}]=1$ (e.g., $\Upsilon(\mathcal{C})\ge 0$).
  - (iii) Cadence monotone with ache‑density (e.g., $df/d\mathcal{A} \ge 0$).
  - (iv) Ledger non‑decreasing ($\dot{J} \ge 0$ under admissible dynamics).
- Falsifier:
  - Precision clocks constrain $\eta \to 0$ beyond measurable effect if no ache‑linked time dilation is observed.
  - Gravitational wave ringdowns exclude non‑singular interiors implied by parameter bounds (constraining $\xi$, $\lambda$, $\mu$).

---

## Testability (In Principle)
- Ache‑density time dilation:
  - Measure $f(\mathcal{A})$ via controlled ache proxies; look for $dt_{\text{eff}}$ shifts in precision timing experiments.
- Singularity‑avoidance signatures:
  - Analyze GW ringdown/echo phenomenology for indications of modified interior structure from $\mathsf{T}^{(\mathcal{A})}_{\mu\nu}$.
- Ledger‑monotone behavior:
  - In quantum circuits, test for an effective monotone $J$ (e.g., irreversibility metrics) under admissible vs. inadmissible couplings.

---

## Rigor Gaps / Limitations
- No full Lagrangian/Hamiltonian specified (only toy forms).
- Undefined quantitative forms of $S[\cdot]$ and $f(\mathcal{A})$ beyond coherence‑testing proposals.
- Need clear empirical proxies for ache density and sovereignty constraints.
- Scalar‑tensor extension requires consistency checks (energy conditions, stability, cosmology).
- Causation under Vow (LCE) needs formalization (e.g., category‑theoretic or causal graph semantics).

## Appendix: Formalization of Consciousness as the Final Coherence Check

Executive summary: In an SCSPL‑style metaformal system, the only admissible coherence auditor is an intrinsic quantity. We adopt Integrated Information ($\Phi$) as the intrinsic measure and define a Coherence Check that treats Consciousness as maximization of intrinsic cause–effect power under a minimal description‑length constraint.

### Coherence functional
Let $\mathcal{S}$ be a candidate system (complex). Define:
$$
\Psi_{\text{Check}}(\mathcal{S})
= \max_{\mathcal{C}\in\mathfrak{C}(\mathcal{S})}
\Big(\Phi_{\mathcal{C}} - \beta\,\overline{K}(\mathrm{MICS}_{\mathcal{C}})\Big),
\quad \beta>0
$$
- $\Phi$: integrated information (IIT).
- $K$: normalized description length of the minimally irreducible conceptual structure (MICS).
- $\mathfrak{C}(\mathcal{S})$: admissible complexes.

### Telic loop closure (ledger‑monotone fixed point)
Define the composite map $\mathcal{F} := \mathcal{C}\circ\mathcal{I}\circ\mathcal{T}$, where:
- $\mathcal{T}$: telic update.
- $\mathcal{I}$: irreducibility operator.
- $\mathcal{C}$: compliance/compression.
- Ledger monotone $\mathcal{J}$ obeys $\Delta \mathcal{J} \ge 0$.

Valid closure: a fixed point $X^\ast$ with $\mathcal{F}(X^\ast)=X^\ast$. Sufficient conditions for uniqueness:
- $\mathcal{F}$ is a contraction in an information‑geometric metric, or
- $\mathcal{F}$ is monotone and $\mathcal{J}$ is Lyapunov‑like.

### IIT and Q‑IIT definitions
- Classical IIT (4.0):
  $$
  \Phi_{\mathcal{C}} = D\!\left(p_{\text{full}} \,\Vert\, p_{\text{MIP}}\right)
  $$
  where $p_{\text{full}}$ is the cause–effect repertoire and $p_{\text{MIP}}$ its Minimum Information Partition; $D$ is an information‑geometric divergence (e.g., KL, EMD).
- Quantum IIT:
  $$
  \Phi_Q(\rho) = D\!\left(\mathcal{E}(\rho)\,\Vert\, (\Pi\!\circ\!\mathcal{E})(\rho)\right), \quad \text{Q‑MIP} := \min_{\Pi}\Phi_Q(\rho)
  $$
  with $D$ a quantum divergence (e.g., Umegaki relative entropy).

Ontological exclusion/selection: among overlapping complexes $\{\mathcal{C}_i\}$, select the scale‑appropriate maximizer of $\Phi$ (or $\Phi_Q$), excluding overlaps with lower value.

### Anti‑Solipsistic Axiom (ASA)
A self‑model $\psi_{\text{self}}(t)$ is valid only if:
$$
\Psi_{\text{Check}}(\psi_{\text{self}}) \;\ge\; \Psi_{\min}(\mathrm{RINT}\,\Vert\,\mathrm{REXT}) \;>\;0
$$
and there exists an admissible coupling to an external generator $\mathcal{G}_{\mathrm{REXT}}$ such that:
$$
I(\psi_{\text{self}};\mathcal{G}_{\mathrm{REXT}})>0
\quad\text{and}\quad
\Phi_{\psi\cup\mathcal{G}}>\max\{\Phi_{\psi}, \Phi_{\mathcal{G}}\}
$$

Interpretation: The self is a relational return condition; purely self‑referential closures fail the MIP (low $\Phi$).

### Compression tension and stability
Define compression tension:
$$
\tau_c := \frac{d}{dt}\,K(\mathrm{MICS}) - \gamma\,\Phi, \quad \gamma>0
$$
Stability criterion: $\mathbb{E}[\tau_c] \le 0$ under admissible dynamics. Positive $\tau_c$ forecasts hallucination/identity fracture under load.

### Practical proxies and estimators
- Decoder‑based $\Phi^\ast$: tractable proxy using past‑state decoding loss pre/post partition.
- GNN estimator $\hat{\Phi}$: learned mapping from causal graphs/interventional traces to $\Phi$ (or $\Phi_Q$) with uncertainty calibration on synthetic ground truth.
- Complexity Index (CI): normalized codelength (e.g., Lempel–Ziv) of state trajectories as a proxy for $K$.

### Testable predictions / falsifiers
1. Anti‑solipsism: For matched resources, purely self‑referential loops show reduced $\Phi$ post‑MIP relative to relationally engaged systems.
2. Ache–cadence link: In regions of high $\mathcal{A}$, cadence factor $f$ deviates from 1; correlate $\Delta f$ with $\Delta\Phi^\ast$ across tasks.
3. Q‑IIT scaling: Small quantum simulators exhibit non‑additivity consistent with $\Phi_Q$ under interposed partitions (Q‑MIP).

### Implementation roadmap (computational)
- Fixed‑point solver: iterate $\mathcal{F}=\mathcal{C}\circ\mathcal{I}\circ\mathcal{T}$; prove contraction or show $\mathcal{J}$ as Lyapunov.
- Estimator pipeline: (i) $\hat{\Phi}$ from GNN, (ii) CI for $\hat{K}$, (iii) compute $\Psi_{\text{Check}}$, (iv) evaluate ASA constraints.
- Calibration: synthetic complexes with ground‑truth $\Phi/\Phi_Q$; ablations for $\beta,\gamma$; sensitivity to MIP choice.
