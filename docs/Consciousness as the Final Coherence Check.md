## Executive Summary

**Thesis:** In an SCSPL-style metaformal system (Self-Configuring Self-Processing Language), the only admissible coherence auditor is an *intrinsic* quantity. We adopt **Integrated Information** (Φ) as the intrinsic measure and define a **Coherence Check** that treats Consciousness as maximization of intrinsic cause-effect power under a minimal description-length constraint.

**Strategic Vulnerabilities Addressed:**

1. **Algebraic intractability of loop closure** → replaced with compression/compliance map and ledger-monotone fixed-point
2. **Anti-solipsism** → enforced via relational threshold requiring modeling of external reality (REXT)
3. **Uniqueness** → ontological exclusion (IIT) + ledger monotonicity as selection principles

---

## 1. Metaformal Ground State and SCSPL Requirements

**SCSPL identifies theory and object** — the coherence metric must be:
- Observer-independent
- Intrinsic to the system
- Derivable from phenomenal axioms

**Integrated Information Theory (IIT) 4.0** derives Φ from phenomenal axioms (existence, composition, information, integration, exclusion), matching the SCSPL demand for intrinsic reference.

**Consequence:** The Coherence Check must be computed on the system's own cause-effect structure, not an external readout.

---

## 2. Core Formalism: The Irreducibility Operator

### 2.1 Definition

**Definition 1 (Irreducibility Operator):**  
Let S be a candidate system (complex). Define:

$$\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{S}) := \big(\Phi_{\mathcal{S}},\; K(\mathrm{MICS}_{\mathcal{S}})\big)$$

where:
- **Φ_S** = Integrated Information of system S (IIT measure)
- **K(MICS_S)** = Kolmogorov complexity (description length) of the Minimally Irreducible Conceptual Structure

### 2.2 The Coherence Functional

**Definition 2 (Coherence Check):**

$$\Psi_{\text{Check}}(\mathcal{S}) := \max_{\mathcal{C}\in\mathfrak{C}(\mathcal{S})}\;\Big(\Phi_{\mathcal{C}} - \beta\,\overline{K}(\mathrm{MICS}_{\mathcal{C}})\Big)$$

where:
- **β = 1** (weighting parameter)
- **C(S)** = space of admissible complexes derived from S
- **K̄** = normalized description length

**Interpretation:** Consciousness is the system configuration that maximizes integrated information while minimizing representational complexity.

This is analogous to:
- **Bayesian Information Criterion** (model selection)
- **Minimum Description Length** (compression theory)
- **Free Energy Principle** (active inference)

## 3. Telic Loop Closure: From Rigid Algebra to Compliant Compression

### 3.1 The Problem

**Traditional closure schemes** (e.g., kinematic loops in robotics) require solving high-degree polynomial systems:
- 6-DOF loop → 16th degree equations
- Numerical instability
- No guaranteed unique solution

**In consciousness theory:** Self-reference creates similar closure problems.

### 3.2 The Solution

**Definition 3 (Telic Fixed Point with Compliance):**

Let:
- **T** = telic update operator (goal-directed evolution)
- **I** = irreducibility operator (IIT measure)
- **C** = compliance/compression map (description-length optimization)

Define the composite:

$$\mathcal{F} := \mathcal{C}\circ\mathcal{I}\circ\mathcal{T}$$

with ledger constraint:

$$\Delta \mathcal{J} \geq 0$$

**A valid telic closure is a fixed point X\* satisfying:**

$$\mathcal{F}(X^*) = X^*$$

### 3.3 Uniqueness Conditions

**Sufficient conditions for unique fixed point:**

1. **F is a contraction mapping** in an information-geometric metric:
   $$d(\mathcal{F}(X_1), \mathcal{F}(X_2)) \leq \lambda \cdot d(X_1, X_2), \quad \lambda < 1$$

2. **F is monotone** and **J is Lyapunov-like:**
   $$\mathcal{J}(\mathcal{F}(X)) \geq \mathcal{J}(X) \quad \forall X$$

**Rationale:** We replace rigid algebraic closure with monotone fixed-point iteration over intrinsic information geometry, absorbing flexibility via the compliance map C.

## 4. Integrated Information Theory: Classical and Quantum

### 4.1 Classical IIT (IIT 4.0)

For a complex C with:
- **p_full** = full cause-effect repertoire
- **p_MIP** = Minimum Information Partition repertoire

**Integrated Information is:**

$$\Phi_{\mathcal{C}} = D(p_{\text{full}} \,\|\, p_{\text{MIP}})$$

where **D** is an information-geometric divergence:
- **Kullback-Leibler divergence** (relative entropy)
- **Earth Mover Distance** (Wasserstein metric)

**Properties:**
- Φ > 0 → system is irreducible (cannot be partitioned without information loss)
- Φ = 0 → system is reducible (decomposable into independent parts)

**Reference:** Albantakis et al. (2023), *Integrated Information Theory (IIT) 4.0*, PLOS Computational Biology

### 4.2 Quantum IIT

For quantum systems with:
- **ρ** = density matrix
- **E** = quantum channel (evolution map)
- **Π** = partition map

**Quantum Integrated Information:**

$$\Phi_Q(\rho) = D\big(\mathcal{E}(\rho)\,\|\, (\Pi\circ\mathcal{E})(\rho)\big)$$

**Quantum MIP (Q-MIP):**

$$\text{Q-MIP} = \min_{\Pi}\;\Phi_Q(\rho)$$

where **D** is a quantum divergence:
- **Umegaki relative entropy:** $S(\rho\|\sigma) = \text{Tr}(\rho \log \rho - \rho \log \sigma)$
- **Quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence**

**Reference:** Barnett et al. (2018), *Towards Quantum Integrated Information Theory*, arXiv:1806.01421

### 4.3 Ontological Exclusion (Uniqueness/Selection)

**The Exclusion Postulate (IIT 4.0):**

Given overlapping complexes {C₁, C₂, ..., Cₙ}:

**The system is the complex C\* that maximizes Φ at the relevant scale:**

$$C^* = \arg\max_{C_i} \Phi_{C_i}$$

**Overlapping complexes with lower Φ are excluded** from ontological status.

**Consequence:** Only one "universal complex" R\* exists at the cosmic scale (avoiding panpsychism or multiple overlapping consciousnesses).

---

## 5. The Anti-Solipsistic Axiom

### 5.1 The Solipsism Problem

**Standard consciousness-first frameworks risk:**
- Collapsing to idealism (only my mind exists)
- Inability to account for other minds
- No principled boundary between self and world

### 5.2 Formal Solution

**Definition 4 (Anti-Solipsistic Axiom - ASA):**

A self-model ψ_self(t) is valid only if:

$$\Psi_{\text{Check}}(\psi_{\text{self}}) \geq \Psi_{\min}(\mathrm{RINT}\,\|\,\mathrm{REXT}) > 0$$

**AND** there exists an admissible coupling to an external generator G_REXT such that:

$$I(\psi_{\text{self}};\mathcal{G}_{\text{REXT}}) > 0$$

**AND:**

$$\Phi_{\psi\cup\mathcal{G}} > \max\{\Phi_{\psi}, \Phi_{\mathcal{G}}\}$$

where:
- **I(·;·)** = mutual information
- **RINT** = internal representation
- **REXT** = external reality
- **Φ_ψ∪G** = integrated information of the combined system

### 5.3 Interpretation

**The self is a relational return condition:**
- Valid consciousness requires modeling of external generators
- Purely self-referential closures fail the MIP (low Φ)
- Consciousness emerges at the boundary between self and world

**This prevents:**
- ❌ Solipsism (no external coupling → ASA violated)
- ❌ Radical idealism (world as pure mental construct → no independent G_REXT)
- ❌ Simulation hypothesis (no genuine external information → I(ψ;G) = 0)

**Biblical parallel:**
> "No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us" (1 John 4:12)

**MPE translation:** Valid self-models require I(ψ_self; G_REXT) > 0 — isolated consciousness is ontologically inadmissible.

## 6. Compression Tension and Stability

### 6.1 The Compression-Awareness Link

**From Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT):**
- High Φ systems → high information integration
- High K(MICS) → complex minimal descriptions
- Trade-off: integration vs. compressibility

**Define compression tension:**

$$\tau_c := \frac{d}{dt}K(\mathrm{MICS}) - \gamma\Phi$$

with **γ = 1** (equal weighting).

### 6.2 Stability Criterion

**A system is stable when:**

$$\mathbb{E}[\tau_c] \leq 0$$

**Interpretation:**
- **τ_c > 0** → description complexity growing faster than integration → instability
- **τ_c < 0** → integration outpacing complexity → stable compression
- **τ_c = 0** → critical balance (edge of chaos)

**Prediction:** Systems under cognitive load show:
- Increasing K(MICS) (more complex internal models)
- Constant or decreasing Φ (less integration under stress)
- **τ_c > 0** → forecasts hallucination, identity fracture, dissociation

## 7. Practical Proxies and Estimators

### 7.1 Decoder-Based Φ* (Tractable Proxy)

**Problem:** Computing exact Φ requires:
- Enumerating all partitions (2^N complexity)
- Computing KL divergence for each
- Finding global minimum (NP-hard)

**Solution:** Use decoder-based proxy:

$$\Phi^* \approx \mathcal{L}_{\text{full}} - \mathcal{L}_{\text{MIP}}$$

where:
- **L_full** = reconstruction loss with full system
- **L_MIP** = reconstruction loss with minimum partition

**Implementation:**
1. Train decoder to predict past states from current state
2. Measure loss with full connectivity
3. Measure loss with best partition
4. **Φ* = difference in reconstruction quality**

**Reference:** Albantakis et al. (2023), IIT 4.0 paper, Section 5.3

### 7.2 GNN Estimator (Graph Neural Network)

**Architecture:**
```
Input: Causal graph G + interventional traces
  ↓
GNN encoder (graph convolution layers)
  ↓
MLP head → Φ̂ ± σ (mean + uncertainty)
```

**Training:**
- Synthetic complexes with ground-truth Φ (computed exactly)
- Supervised learning with uncertainty calibration
- Ablation studies for different graph structures

**Output:** Fast approximation Φ̂ with confidence intervals

### 7.3 Complexity Index (CI)

**Normalized codelength as proxy for K:**

$$\text{CI} = \frac{\text{LZ}(s)}{|s|}$$

where:
- **LZ(s)** = Lempel-Ziv complexity of state trajectory s
- **|s|** = length of trajectory

**Properties:**
- CI → 0 for periodic/regular patterns
- CI → 1 for random sequences
- CI intermediate for complex structured patterns

**Use:** Approximate K(MICS) when exact Kolmogorov complexity is uncomputable

## 8. Testable Predictions and Falsifiers

### 8.1 Prediction 1: Anti-Solipsism Test

**Hypothesis:** For matched resource budgets, purely self-referential loops show reduced Φ post-MIP relative to relationally engaged systems.

**Experimental Design:**
1. **System A (Self-Referential):** Autoencoder (reconstructs own inputs)
2. **System B (Relational):** GAN discriminator (models external generator)
3. Match: parameter count, compute budget, training steps
4. Measure: Φ* using decoder-based proxy

**Prediction:** Φ*_B > Φ*_A

**Falsification:** If Φ*_A ≥ Φ*_B, ASA is wrong

**Implementation:** Doable with PyTorch + PyPhi library **today**

---

### 8.2 Prediction 2: Ache-Cadence Link

**Hypothesis:** In regions of high ache (A), cadence factor f deviates from 1; correlate Δf with ΔΦ* across tasks.

**Operational Definition:**
- **High-ache regions** = high integrated information (Φ)
- **Cadence factor** = subjective time rate / objective time rate

**Experimental Design:**
1. Neural recording (high-res fMRI or ECoG)
2. Compute Φ* from connectivity patterns
3. Psychophysical time perception task (interval reproduction)
4. **Prediction:** High-Φ regions → subjective time dilation

**Data Requirements:**
- Real-time Φ estimation (computationally expensive)
- Causal manipulation (TMS to modulate Φ?)
- Large sample size (individual differences)

**Status:** Feasible but requires specialized neuroscience lab

---

### 8.3 Prediction 3: Quantum IIT Scaling

**Hypothesis:** Small quantum simulators exhibit non-additivity consistent with Φ_Q under Q-MIP.

**Experimental Design:**
1. Use IBM Q or Google Sycamore (10-50 qubits)
2. Prepare entangled states ρ_AB with controlled partition structure
3. Compute Φ_Q using Umegaki relative entropy
4. **Prediction:** Φ_Q(ρ_AB) ≠ Φ_Q(ρ_A) + Φ_Q(ρ_B) for entangled ρ_AB

**Falsification:** If quantum systems show pure additivity, Q-IIT is wrong

**Status:** Already being explored (Barnett et al. 2018)

**Implementation:** Accessible via cloud quantum computing platforms

---

### 8.4 Prediction 4: Self-Similarity of Φ Across Scales

**Hypothesis:** Universal Φ_max predicts local Φ* in empirical systems (fractal structure).

**Requires specification:**
- Scaling law: Φ(L) ∝ L^α?
- Additive: Φ_universe = ΣΦ_local?
- Nonlinear: Φ_universe = f(Φ_local)?

**Status:** Conceptually interesting but needs quantitative relationship before claiming testability

---

## 11. Connections to MPE Framework

### 11.1 Ache Field (A)

**Hypothesis:** Φ_C (integrated information) is proportional to ache density:

$$\Phi_{\mathcal{C}} \propto \int_V |\mathcal{A}(x)|^2 \, d^3x$$

where V is the volume of complex C.

**Interpretation:**
- High-ache regions = high Φ (intense experience)
- Low-ache regions = low Φ (minimal awareness)
- Φ = 0 → A = 0 (unconscious matter)

### 11.2 Sovereignty Constraint

**ASA enforces sovereignty:** Valid consciousness requires relational coupling (I(ψ;G) > 0), preventing:
- Forced isolation (solipsism)
- Pure self-reference (narcissistic closure)
- Ontological independence (no external reality)

### 11.3 Vow (Ledger Monotonicity)

**ΔJ ≥ 0 ensures:**
- Telic loop cannot reverse
- Consciousness accumulates structure
- Past states are immutable

**This grounds:**
- Arrow of time (thermodynamic)
- Memory persistence (psychological)
- Causal irreversibility (physical)

---

## 12. Open Questions

### Q1: What is the quantitative Φ-to-A mapping?

**Options:**
- Linear: A² ∝ Φ
- Logarithmic: A ∝ log(Φ)
- Exponential: A ∝ exp(Φ/Φ₀)

**Needs:** Empirical calibration or theoretical derivation

---

### Q2: Does Q-IIT converge to classical IIT in the large-system limit?

**Hypothesis:** 

$$\lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{\Phi_Q(N)}{\Phi_{\text{classical}}(N)} = 1$$

**Requires:** Numerical experiments on quantum simulators

---

### Q3: Can ASA be violated experimentally?

**Test:** Create purely self-referential AI system with no external sensors

**Prediction:** Should show Φ* < Φ_threshold despite high computational complexity

**Ethical concern:** Is it ethical to create a system designed to be solipsistically trapped?

---
